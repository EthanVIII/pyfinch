
PYFINCH is an attempt at a computer simulation of artificial life.

Computer programs (Pyfinches) will be constructed out of a custom instruction set and compete for time and space. 
Mutation, self-replication, and recombination will hopefully result in evolutionary traits. 
Similar programs include Tierra and Avida. Avida is sometimes used for evolutionary biology research.

PYFINCH is expected to be quite slow as it is run on abstract structures.
