# PYFINCH - Self Replicating and Evolving Programs. WIP!
Pyfinch is an attempt to create self-replicating and evolving computer programs.

This is a beginner's learning project.

Computer programs (Pyfinches) will be constructed out of custom instruction sets and compete for time and space. Mutation, self-replication, and recombination result in evolutionary traits being expressed.

Pyfinch is heavily inspired by [Tierra](https://github.com/acisternino/tierra) and [Avida](https://github.com/devosoft/avida).
